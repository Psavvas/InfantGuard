            <div class="description">
                <p>
                    InfantGuard is a comprehensive vehicle safety monitoring system designed to help prevent Pediatric Vehicular Heatstroke (PVH) 
                    incidents and injuries attributed to the Forgotten Baby Syndrome (FBS). InfantGuard can detect whether an infant is left 
                    unattended and automtically alert the caregiver via SMS text message. Furthermore InfantGuard monitors the vehicle's interior 
                    temperature and will automtically notify emergancy services with vehicle location, temperature and license plate, if temperatures 
                    reach dangerous levels.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Why InfantGuard</h2>
                <p>
                Every year in the United States, dozens of children die from heatstroke after being left unattended in vehicles. Since 1998, over 
                1000 casualties have occurred due to Forgotten Baby Syndrome (FBS). As its name implies, FBS is completely unintentional and accidental; 
                the parent gets busy and forgets. Infants are at risk of fatal heatstroke at temperatures as low as 107°F, and a vehicle's interior can 
                reach 120°F in just 30 minutes—even on mild days. Immediate action is critical to prevent tragedy. InfantGuard aims to reduce these tragic 
                incidents by providing caregivers with a reliable system to monitor their infants' safety in vehicles.
                </p>
                <h2>Features</h2>
                <p>
                    InfantGuard offers a range of advanced features to ensure the safety of infants in vehicles from autonmous monitoring to real-time alerts:

                            <h3>Multiple Sensors</h3>
                            <p>
                                InfantGuard uses multiple sensors to ensure no infant movement goes undetected, including two FSR sensors, a
                                temperature sensor, and an HM-10 Bluetooth receiver.

                            <p>
                                Docking components for the FSR wiring let the seat be removed and returned quickly while sensors reconnect
                                automatically.

                                InfantGuard evaluates vehicle temperature, parent presence, and infant presence to choose the right action based on
                                situation severity.

                                A Bluetooth fob attached to car keys detects parent presence so InfantGuard knows when the parent is gone.
